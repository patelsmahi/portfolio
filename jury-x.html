            <p>Jury X is a platform built on trust. It connects people with legal professionals during high stakes, often stressful moments. However, when I first analyzed their website, I found that instead of reassuring users, the interface created confusion. The navigation made it difficult to understand who the team was, what they offered, and how to get started. For this redesign, my goal was to remove those barriers. I focused on creating a clearer, more intuitive experience that makes information accessible at first glance while reinforcing Jury X’s brand identity and credibility.

                <h3>Audience Analysis </h3>
                <p>Before starting my redesign, I needed to understand who I was designing for. Knowing the audience is critical because it guides every design decision. For my audience analysis, I combined independent research with ChatGPT to help generate key questions and categories. From this process, I identified key insights about Jury X’s users that directly shaped my design decisions.</p>

                <h3>Persona List </h3>
                <p>After defining my audience, I created user personas to better capture their needs and behaviors. Building on the insights from my audience analysis, I developed three key personas.
                <br>
                <br>
                After developing my personas, I completed a deeper analysis to bring them to life. This included creating persona posters and an empathy map. These tools helped me better understand the average user and the reasoning behind their decisions. For this project, I chose to focus on Efficient Ella.</p>

                <p>I conducted a card sort to understand where users would expect to find information. This step was crucial in shaping the organization of my Jury X redesign, since unclear navigation was the primary issue driving the project. While the card sort provided a strong foundation, I refined the structure further during the design process. The resulting information hierarchy more clearly illustrates how the website’s content is organized.</p>

                <h3>User Testing and Design Changes</h3>
                <p>To validate my redesign before presenting it to the Jury-X team, I conducted testing through UserTesting.com. I gathered feedback from three legal professionals, which provided valuable insight into what felt intuitive and what did not. This feedback was essential in refining the final product.</p>

                <br> 
                <p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      <b>User 1</b>
                      <p>“I'll give it a four because the, the book your trial now button was all the way at the bottom, and if you don't scroll all the way to the bottom, you wouldn't know it's there.”
                        <br>
                      <b> Suggestion: Add “Book a Trail” button to top of services page."</b>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>User 2</b>
                      <p>“So as long as that's explained upfront to the client, I don't think there's an issue with that.”
                        <br>
                        <b> Suggestion: Make information  more transparent.</b>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      <b>User 3</b>
                      <p>“This does look like, you know, some, an organization that, that knows what they're doing. Uh, just make it a little bit clearer insofar as how to contact them.”
                      <br>
                        <b> Suggestion: Make sure all team members are listed and clickable.</b>
                      </p>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </p>

                <br> 
                <br> 
                <p> User testing provided valuable insight into how new users navigated my design. Based on this feedback, I was able to adjust areas of confusion. For example, I noticed the 'Book Your Trial' button was difficult to access on the Services page, so I repositioned it higher on the page to increase visibility.



                  Overall, the feedback was very positive. Users described the interface as intuitive, and most rated it a 4 or 5 for ease of navigation and task completion. This confirmed that the redesign successfully improved usability and created a more user-friendly experience.</p>

                <br>
                <br>

                <p> Based on the user testing results, I incorporated the suggested changes, where they aligned with project goals—into the final wireframe.</p>

        <h3>Results</h3>
        <p>With the design changes complete, my final prototype was ready. The Jury X redesign transforms a confusing, cluttered interface into a clear, user-friendly experience that builds trust and simplifies navigation
          <br>
          <br>

          This project gave me an in-depth understanding of the UI/UX process. I also learned to leverage various AI tools to assist throughout the Jury X redesign.
          
          <br>
          <br>
          
          The most insightful part for me was the user research. Having had less experience in this area, I really enjoyed connecting research findings to the UI and translating them into actionable design decisions. While this process was challenging, it was also highly rewarding.
          
          <br>
          <br>
          
          Finally, refining the design based on user testing allowed the project to truly come together. Overall, I am proud to have grown both my UI and UX skills through this project.
